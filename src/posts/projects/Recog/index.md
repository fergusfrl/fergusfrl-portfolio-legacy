##### The story
Developers get into a flow when working. The mythical 'flow' is amazing, it allows us to chase and follow ideas from beginning to end over unnoticed hours and produce incredible results.<br/>
Naturally anything that breaks this flow should be avoided.<br/>
When working in React - I've found that creating new files for components can break my flow. Creating new components is common - each component has it's own file and then usually it's own test file,stylesheet, story, actions, reducers and more! That's a whole lot of new files per component.<br/>
It's easy work but it's mundane and repedative - exactly the kind of work which break 'flow'.

##### The solution
Other frameworks have solved this problem - Angular, Vue and Ember all supply inbuilt Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for creating new components from the command line. React doesn't have this functionality.<br/>
My solution to this repedative task was to create a CLI in the vein of other frameworks which can generate new folders, component files, stylesheets, test files and bootstrap them all while at it.<br/>
I named it **Recog** - the **Re**act **Co**mponent **G**enerator.

##### The result
It works!<br/>
I've used it in a handful of my own projects and experimentation and prefer it as a way to develop.<br/>
I've found it helpful enough that I decided to publish the project to npm. Recog is now available for anyone to use. My hope is that Recog will see wide use thorugh the react community.
