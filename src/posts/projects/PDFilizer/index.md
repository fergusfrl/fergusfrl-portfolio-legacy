##### The Story
At University, I had a techniqueue for studying for exams; I would get my hands on as many previous exams as possible (usually around 5) then I would count how ofter particular topics were covered by exams. This approach was surprisingly helpful at identifying patterns in exams, for example, some questions were asked every 2nd year, some topics were never both asked in the same year etc.<br />
The process was helpful but repedative.<br />
Well - as a budding computer scientist - repedative and mundane tasks are tasks asking for automation!<br />

##### The Challenge
I had inadvertedly stumbled upon the problem of natural language processing. Unfortunately (for my bank account) I didn't solve this problem. I was able to identify key words and phrases which tured out to be good enough for what I needed. Success!<br />

##### The Result
I used this script in my final 2 semesters at university and found it really great :)
It was my first foray into automating process in my life and was the start of me applying my craft to solving real work problems, I was hooked.
