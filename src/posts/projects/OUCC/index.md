##### The Story
At university I was heavily involved in the Otago University Canoe Club (OUCC). I was a member for 6 years and on the committee for the 4. We had an outdated signup system and out marketing involved attending university club events. Myself and another club member who also studied computer science decided to create out first website.<br />

##### The Challenge
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE WEBSITES!!<br />
We had coded in Java and Python to solve mathamatical and computer science problem, we had not used html or css to render things to a browser.<br />
Lots of reading, lots of tutorials, help from lecturers and we got up a simple static website up and running. 

##### The Result
In hindsight the UI is terrible, we broke a few best practices and the code is pretty messy but gosh-darn am I proud of my first ever website! It set me on the path of web development and I haven't looked back.
