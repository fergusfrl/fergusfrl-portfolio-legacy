##### The Story
New Zealand has 16 councils which each measure and record telementary river data. Each council stores and surfaces this data in different ways, some have REST API's, some surface HTML while others have downloadable content!<br />
We decided to bring each of these datasources together into a single platform and make it available to anyone who needed it.
